This study was conducted by Marius Brülhart, Rafael Lalive, Valentin Klotzbücher, and Stephanie K. Reich, who are professors of economics at various global universities, including the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, and the University of Freiburg, Germany. They also have affiliations with the Centre for Economic Policy Research in the UK, and the Swiss National Science Foundation, which provided funding for this research.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in people who were infected with the virus. The main quantifier of mental health condition was data from helplines which specialized in areas such as suicide prevention, or had specific target groups such as women or children. The null hypothesis for this study was that the COVID-19 pandemic was not an influencial factor in mental health, while the alternative hypothesis is that the pandemic negatively affected mental health.

The data used was from various sources, with some being publicly available, while others were not. Information on infection rates was collected from public resources, such as the Oxford COVID-19 response tracker and JHU CSSE COVID-19 dataset. On the other hand, the data used about helplines was specifically requested by the researchers. As they note in the "Data Availability" section of the paper, a confidentiality agreement was reached between the helplines and the authors, most likely to preserve the privacy of those who seeked help. 

The data referenced was used to draw conclusions about the relationship between pandemic-driven factors and the number of people who seeked help. Specifically, by analyzing the discussions that were taking place over the phone, the study was able to conclude that an increased number of helpline calls was likely due to fear about the virus. Similarly, another reason that people were calling in was because of depression or anxiety driven by loneliness, especially because of isolation and quarantine. 

The researchers backed up their claims by relating their findings or cross-checking with other phenomenon that had been studied. For example, this study found that the majority of people who were seeking out helplines were over the age of 30 - this is consistent with findings that susceptibility to COVID-19 increases with age, which would explain why this age group would have an increased fear of the virus. 

One factor that was mentioned in the paper was that because of the increased demand for calls, many helplines actually had to turn away callers. The authors argue that this did not affect the overall data about why calls were being made, because the decision on whether or not to pick up a call is not based on the reason for the call, but rather on availability. Thus, the percentage of people who were calling for a COVID-19-related reason would be unaffected. However, it would be interesting to see if people who were turned away also had a COVID-19-realted reason for their call. 

Another possible limitation of the methodology used in this study, namely the use of helpline data, is that not everybody has access to a phone when they are in distress. For example, people who are of a disadvantaged socio-economic background would be less likely to have access to a helpline. Additionally, helplines are not the only way that people seek assistance when their mental health is declined - it would be interesting to look at data about whether or not the amount of people seeking therapy increased, or investigate other forms of mental health support.

I do not believe that "publish or perish" had a great influence on this study, however it is possible. Because this study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, it may be the case that the researchers felt pressured to make a significant finding. Additionally, because the researchers are professors, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic limited their opportunities to conduct significant research at a university and achieve tenure - however, I think there must have been a lot to research regarding economics and the pandemic, so this is unlikely.

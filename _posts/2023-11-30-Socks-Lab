In this lab, I used an API to obtain data about Animal Crossing Socks, and then analyzed various aspects of the sock data. 

To obtain data from the API, I used the requests.get function. The base URL and endpoint were constant, and in the payload, I included the API key to make sure that I was authorized to access the server. Then, I realized that the idx parameter only lets you access individual rows at for each time that the requests.get function is called. Therefore, created a "for" loop to iterate through every row of the index and retrieve data each time.

To determine which type of sock has the most variations, I first created a list of all the names of the socks, by iterating through each row and adding the sock name if it did not already exist in the list. Then, I also added these sock names as keys to a dictionary that would contain sock names as keys and the number of variations for that sock as a value. I realized that each time a sock of the same type comes up, the variation is different. So, I iterated through the data again, adding one to the number of variations of the type of sock that the item was.

To figure out how many socks of each color there were, I followed a similar process. First, I created a list of all the possible sock colors by iterating through each sock and adding its color 1 or color 2 to the list if either one was not already in it. Next, I created a dictionary with sock colors as keys and number of socks with that color as values. Lastly, I iterated through the socks again, and I added 1 to the key value of the corresponding sock color. To account for whether or not the color 1 was the same as color 2 for a specific sock, I only added 1 to the key value for sock 2 if it was different from color 1.
